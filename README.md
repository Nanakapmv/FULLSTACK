This project aims to streamline communication and scheduling in educational institutions, ensuring students are not overwhelmed with conflicting messages. Faculty members can propose schedules for announcements related to events or activities, which require prior approval from the admin. The admin reviews the proposed schedules, taking into account any significant events already planned, and provides feedback or approval. Once approved, the faculty can proceed with the announcements accordingly. This system helps to avoid scheduling conflicts, ensuring smooth communication and efficient planning across the institution.
